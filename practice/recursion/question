🟢 Beginner Level (Build intuition)
- Factorial of a number
- Fibonacci sequence (nth term, printing first n terms)
- Sum of digits of a number
- Reverse a string using recursion
- Check if a string is palindrome recursively
- Print numbers from 1 to N (forward and backward)

🟡 Intermediate Level (Patterns & problem-solving)
- Power function: compute x^n using recursion
- Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) using Euclid’s algorithm
- Tower of Hanoi (classic recursion problem)
- Generate all subsets of a set (power set)
- Generate all permutations of a string
- Count ways to climb stairs (like Fibonacci, but with choices of 1 or 2 steps)
- Binary Search implemented recursively

🔴 Advanced Level (Interview-style challenges)
- N-Queens problem (place queens on a chessboard without attacking each other)
- Sudoku solver using backtracking
- Rat in a Maze (find path through a grid)
- Word Search in a matrix (DFS recursion)
- Generate balanced parentheses for n pairs
- Recursive tree traversals (preorder, inorder, postorder)
- Find all paths in a graph using DFS recursion
