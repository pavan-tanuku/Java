🟢 EASY LEVEL (Warm-up)
👉 Goal: Understand traversal
- Search an element in an integer array
- Search an element in a string array
- Find whether a given number exists or not
- Find the first occurrence of an element
- Count how many times an element appears
💡 Hint: Start from index 0, compare one by one.


🟡 EASY → MEDIUM
👉 Goal: Apply small logic with linear search
- Find the last occurrence of an element
- Find the maximum element in an array
- Find the minimum element in an array
- Count even and odd numbers in an array
- Find the index of the largest element
💡 Hint: Keep updating a variable while traversing.


🔵 MEDIUM LEVEL
👉 Goal: Combine linear search with conditions
- Find all indices where an element occurs
- Check if an array is sorted or not
- Find the second largest element
- Find the first repeating element
- Find the first non-repeating element
💡 Hint: Use flags or extra variables.


🔴 MEDIUM → HARD
👉 Goal: Slight twist, still linear traversal
- Search an element in a 2D array
- Find the row and column of a given element
- Find the majority element (appears > n/2 times)
- Find the element with maximum frequency
- Check if two arrays have common elements
💡 Hint: Nested loops allowed.


🧵 STRING-BASED (Linear Search on Strings)
👉 Goal: Apply linear search on characters
- Search a character in a string
- Count frequency of each character
- Find first repeating character
- Find first non-repeating character
- Check if a string contains only digits
💡 Hint: charAt(i) is your friend.
